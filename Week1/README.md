<h1>Five topics related to computing</h1>
<ol>
  <li>    
Application Security – I’m interested in learning more about OWASP and security measures that big tech companies use to prevent leaks and privacy threats. 
  </li>
<li>
  Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning – Machine learning in general is quite a hot topic, and I am eager to learn more on how it can improve our daily lives or impact the world in general.
</li>
  <li>
Web Development (Primarily Front End Development/Programming) – I am currently a Software Engineer Intern in a Front End team, and it has been a blast learning and gaining experience in web development. I believe, although it looks easy, Front End Development is a very complex topic once you get into system design and scalability.
  </li>
  <li>
Embedded Programming – I have little experience in embedded programming and have some experience in C++. I promised myself this summer to complete a 30 day challenge on inventr to learn more C++ and Arduino. https://inventr.io/product/adventure-kit-30-days-lost-in-space/ 
  </li>
  <li>
Big Data/Data Engineering – Big data and Data Engineering is a fascinating field in that you’re about to use ETL to shape large amounts of data into how you need it! I’m very excited to learn more about data engineering and Machine Learning at the same time!

<h1>Five topics that you feel are difficult right now or topics that you think are generally difficult topics related to computer or computing</h1>
<ol>
  <li>
Machine learning is one of that things that I have a hard time wrapping my head around the topic. I have a few simple pet projects in which I used PyTorch and TensorFlow – but dealing with models and training processes left me both challenged and intrigued. I’d love to continue to learn more on Machine Learning, and I am looking into a masters following graduation to specialize in this field.
  </li>
  <li>
Robotics has an intersection between software, mechanical, and electrical engineering – which makes it very difficult to master as it covers several domains. I think this is difficult as you deal with a lot of low-level languages, and each domain requires a unique skill set.
  </li>
  <li>
Networking is an ever-growing topic that introduces new protocols and security measures, but even the fundamentals has left my head hurting at moments. This is an important topic to know in computing and as a Software Engineer as there will be a lot of overlap when dealing with the cloud such as AWS, Azure, or GCP.
  </li>
  <li>
Computer Graphics in general seems like a difficult topic as it seems complex with individuals needing to have a robust foundation in math such as Linear Algebra, Geometry, and Calculus. I believe it also deals with a lot of complex algorithms and low level code, but it does seem like an exciting topic to learn, although it is rather difficult.
  </li>
  <li>
Computer Architecture is a challenging subject for me due to its intricate blend of low-level hardware details and high-level system design. I’ve read through some pre-work at OSU 271 and am currently prepping for a successful semester for this class.
